At **Tweeti**, we believe you should always know what data you're sharing — and why. When you connect your **GitHub** or **X (formerly Twitter)** account, we only store the information that’s **essential** for your experience, and nothing more.



## 🧾 What We Collect

> We store only your **GitHub username** — that’s your public handle (like `@octocat`). We never access your email, private repos, or any sensitive data.

> We securely store **access credentials** that allow Tweeti to post on your behalf — only if you choose to connect your X account.

## 🔐 How We Protect Your Data


All sensitive data is stored **securely in NeonDB**, a modern cloud-native Postgres database.


- Credentials are stored **server-side**, never exposed to your browser or the public.
- We use **serverless functions** to write data safely to our database.
- No one outside our system — not even us — can see your sensitive tokens.

## 🎯 Why We Store It

- So you can **post tweets directly from Tweeti**.
- To **personalize your experience** using your GitHub identity.
- To avoid asking you to reconnect accounts each time.


> You stay in full control — disconnect anytime.

## ✅ Your Trust Matters

We designed Tweeti to be lightweight, respectful, and secure by default. We don’t over-collect, and we never sell or share your data.

If you ever have questions about what we store or how we use it, [reach out to us](mailto:tweeti23official@gmail.com). We’re happy to explain.

Thanks for trusting Tweeti. We’ll keep earning it.
